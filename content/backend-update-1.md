For the past month or so, we've been working on switching our backend to use a different set of libraries for authentication and such.  
The original codebase got wiped, and then reimplemented using:

- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) for the server
- [Gin-jwt](https://github.com/appleboy/gin-jwt) for JWT Authentication
- [Gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm/) (Go ORM) for the Postgres interactions
- [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) for building the GraphQL servers

Alongside just using GraphQL as initially planned, we're also using a JSON API which is generated by the GraphQL API.  
If you're interested in the more technical details, see [PR #56](https://github.com/speedrun-website/leaderboard-backend/pull/56) on the backend Github!
