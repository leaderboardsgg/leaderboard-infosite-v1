description: Welcome to the new redone landing page! This will be where information is posted until we complete work on the main site!

We've revamped the landing page for this site (you're looking at it btw). Unlike the other landing page, this site is built via Nuxt and Tailwind, just like how we're planning on building our launch version of this site!  
This was built with the original design of the site in mind; So if you keep constantly checking this site, you shouldn't see much of a stylistic difference from this and the launch site. The code itself is also based off of the existing [Front-End](https://github.com/speedrun-website/speedrun.website) and the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/team/995764790048471632/Speedrun-Leaderboards?fuid=998362306001357480) designs.
</br></br>
As always, all of the code for this site is available over on [Github](https://github.com/speedrun-website/speedrun-infosite)!
